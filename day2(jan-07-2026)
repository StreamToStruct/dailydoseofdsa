961. N Repeated Elements in size 2N Array: EASYYYYYY
  here you can learn about concept called Set in java (Simply I can say Its a collection and an Interface)
  In this problem every element exists once only only 1 element exists more than once only 1 one element and we need to find that element.
  class Solution {
    public int repeatedNTimes(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();

        for (int i : nums) {
            if (seen.contains(i))
                return i;
            seen.add(i);
        }
        return -1;
        
        
    }
}
