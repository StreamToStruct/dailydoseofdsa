This took me nearly 23 minutes to solve.
No much explanation is needed to this. Its pretty easy.
But wanted to add one bruteforce python code which makes me remember map , join
def plusOne(digits):
    num = int("".join(map(str, digits)))
    num += 1
    return list(map(int, str(num)))

[1,2,3]
   ↓ map(str)
["1","2","3"]
   ↓ join
"123"
   ↓ int
123
   ↓ +1
124
   ↓ str
"124"
   ↓ map(int)
[1,2,4]
